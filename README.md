# ðŸ§ª QA Automation Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my **QA skills in both manual and automated testing**, using **Python + Selenium, Java + Selenium**, and demonstrating **CI/CD integration**.

This portfolio highlights:

* Manual test design and execution
* Automation in **two programming languages**
* Real-world QA workflow with **CI/CD pipelines**
* Professional project documentation

---

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

### 1. [SauceDemo Tests](./saucedemo-tests)

**Focus:** End-to-end workflows for a demo e-commerce site

* âœ… Manual test cases (`test-cases.xlsx`)
* âœ… Automation in **Python + Java**
* âœ… **Continuous Integration** through GitHub Actions
* âœ… Covers login, add-to-cart, checkout workflows

---

### 2. [HerokuApp Tests](./herokuapp-tests)

**Focus:** UI components & technical edge cases

* âœ… Manual test cases (`test-cases.xlsx`)
* âœ… Automation in **Python + Java**
* âœ… **Continuous Integration** through GitHub Actions
* âœ… Covers alerts, dropdowns, file uploads, dynamic elements

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, Java
* **Automation:** Selenium WebDriver, Pytest, JUnit/TestNG
* **Design Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Maven, Pip
* **Manual QA:** Test case design, regression, smoke, exploratory testing

---

## ðŸš€ How to Explore

* Each project contains its **own README** with setup & run instructions.
* Clone the repo and run tests in Python (`pip install -r requirements.txt` + `pytest`) or Java (`mvn clean test`).
* CI/CD workflow runs automatically on GitHub Actions when code is pushed.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Portfolio Stands Out

* Demonstrates **manual + automation testing**
* Shows **cross-language expertise** (Python + Java)
* Includes **CI/CD Integration**, simulating real team workflows
* Organized, professional, and easy for recruiters to explore
